title: Subnets 101
description: Crash course in Avalanche subnets
---

Scaling has become one of the most interesting conversations in Web3, as networks seek to match the millions of new users entering the space. Ethereum’s gas fees and Solana’s numerous outages show how important scaling solutions have become, especially for the future of DeFi. Avalanche takes a unique approach to this with subnets, diverting away traffic that would otherwise congest its main chain.

## Avalanche Multiverse

The Avalanche Foundation recently announced a US$290 Million (4 million $AVAX) incentive program to help develop subnets. This “Avalanche Multiverse” Program seeks to grow its subnets and expand use cases. DeFi, games, NFTs, and even institutional blockchains can all function on Avalanche without congesting their main network.

### Revenue opportunities?

Each subnet with a unique token offers a yield farming DEFI opportunity to validators with stronger nodes, as they can buy tokens to stake and accrue additional interest from subnet fees.

### Are subnets the future?

While many blockchains have tried to achieve scalability in their own way, there has been no clear winner yet.

Arbitrum recently went down, Polkadot Parachains have limited slots, and Polygon experienced congestion due to a P2E game.

In fact, many scaling solutions sacrifice an aspect of the blockchain trilemma (Scalability, Security, and Decentralization) to achieve better throughput

```js
/** @type {import('@tailwindlabs/lorem').ipsum} */
export default {
  lorem: 'ipsum',
  dolor: ['sit', 'amet', 'consectetur'],
  adipiscing: {
    elit: true,
  },
}
```

The great thing about subnets is you never run out of them. You can just keep creating new subnets every time a scaling limit is reached. There is no real disadvantage to doing so aside from convenience. Security is maintained by subnets having their own token that must be staked in conjunction with AVAX, otherwise they are just marginally less secure than the default subnet.

## The Best Of All Worlds

Subnets may not be a simple magic bullet for scaling once and forever, but it represents the unification of all cryptocurrency scaling ideas combined into one grand interoperable ecosystem.

### Subnets vs. L2s

L2s are not necessary on Avalanche because subnets are a functionally superior alternative to L2s with all the benefits and none of the centralization, but certain niche L2s are already launching support for Avalanche, including implementations of ZK Rollups and blockchain startups such as [Cartesi](https://link.medium.com/sZ9KlHvbPeb) who provide a programmable data layer.

### About Avalanche

Avalanche is an open-source platform for launching decentralized finance applications and enterprise blockchain deployments in one interoperable, highly scalable ecosystem. Developers who build on Avalanche can easily create powerful, reliable, and secure applications and custom blockchain networks with complex rulesets or build on existing private or public subnets.
