## Introduction

Understand how to modify the configuration of your subnet.

### Prerequisites

...

### Requirements

...

## Getting Started

Learn how to operate and secure your asset bridge, in production.

## Conclusion

That’s it! That’s the entire implementation of a Virtual Machine which defines a blockchain-based timestamp server.

### In this tutorial we learned

- The `snowman.ChainVM` interface, which all Virtual Machines that define a linear chain must implement
- The `snowman.Block` interface, which all blocks that are part of a linear chain must implement
- The `core.SnowmanVM` and core.Block library types, which make defining Virtual Machines faster
