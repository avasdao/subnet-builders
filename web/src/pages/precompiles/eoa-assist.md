## Introduction

Understand how to modify the configuration of your subnet.

## Getting Started

TBD

## Conclusion

Thatâ€™s it!

There are countless decentralized applications that can utilize the convenience of external storage providers directly connected to their contracts.

### In this tutorial we learned

- The `snowman.ChainVM` interface, which all Virtual Machines that define a linear chain must implement
- The `snowman.Block` interface, which all blocks that are part of a linear chain must implement
- The `core.SnowmanVM` and core.Block library types, which make defining Virtual Machines faster

### Troubleshooting

There are still issues that need to be solved, related to:

1. Contract permissions
2. Data availability
2. Pinning
3. Data expiration

#### Contract permissions

It's important that you call either `setAdmin` OR `setEnabled` with your contract address, otherwise, your `mintNativeCoin` transaction will get rejected.

## What's Next?

Don't stop here! Let's move on to bigger and better things.

### Recommended use-cases

1. NFT artwork storage
2. Data archives
3. Rich-media (ie. photos &amp; videos)
4. other
